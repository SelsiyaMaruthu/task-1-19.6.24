HTTP/1.1
    * The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.
    * Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
    *  This version is still in use on the web.

HTTP/2
    * In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
    * HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
    * In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
    * One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
