/*OBJECT

 Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol)
 in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

  Syntax:

new Object(value)

Object(value)

let object_name = {
    key_name : value,
    ...
}
 
    Internal   Representation of JavaScript Objects

1. Properties: Properties are key-value pairs that define the characteristics or attributes of an object.
 In the example above, firstName, lastName, and age are properties of the person object.

2.   Methods: Methods are functions that are associated with an object. 
   They allow objects to perform actions or computations. In the person object, getAddress is a method.

3.   Prototype: Each object in JavaScript is associated with a prototype, which is another object.
 The prototype defines properties and methods that are shared among all instances of that object type. 
This enables inheritance in JavaScript, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototype.

4. Hidden Properties: JavaScript engines, like V8 (used in Chrome) and SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), 
store additional information about objects that is not directly accessible from JavaScript code.
 These hidden properties help optimize the execution of JavaScript code.

 5.Object Shape: Objects in JavaScript can change dynamically during runtime.
  The JavaScript engine may optimize an object's internal structure based on its usage,
   which can result in changes to its shape and representation. */
